### Who Should Have a Say? Preferences for Unequal Representation

Equal representation is at the core of representative democracy, but are citizens actually in favour of it? As heated debates about the influence of certain groups make clear, people may take a variety of stances toward differentiated representation (i.e. differential group influence over policy). A citizen may believe, for example, that when it comes to designing integration policies, recent immigrants deserve to have extra influence (due to greater affectedness), less influence (due to vested interests), or the same amount of influence as everyone else. What is more, that same citizen might simultaneously hold very different preferences regarding other groups and policy areas (e.g. bankers with financial legislation, retirees with eldercare). These preferences matter because they shape how politicians behave, both in designing policy and in trying to attract votes – yet we know surprisingly little about them.

Funded by a Marie Curie Individual Fellowship, this project investigates attitudes toward the influence of specific groups on issues those groups care about. It does so via innovative survey experiments in the US and the Netherlands that set out to explore (1) the nature and (2) the determinants of preferences for unequal representation. The findings of this research will have important implications for NGOs, scholars, and others seeking to better understand and mitigate majority-minority tensions in democracies.

### Universalism and the Welfare State

How committed are citizens to universalism, redistribution, and the welfare state, and what factors shape their commitment? Through my ongoing affiliation with the UNIWEL (Universalism and the Welfare State) project at Aarhus University, I have investigated various topics related to this theme. This has included papers researching:
- [The attitudinal effects of the structure of inequality across the income spectrum](https://anthonykevins.github.io/files/Yardsticks_Inequality.pdf)
- [The equality and welfare content of party manifestoes](https://anthonykevins.github.io/files/Peeping_Corpus.pdf)
- [The attitudinal implications of class identity](https://anthonykevins.github.io/files/Illusion_Class.pdf)
- The reciprocal relationship between workfare reforms and welfare state preferences
- The motives citizens attribute to those with pro-/anti-redistribution stances

Much of this research has been rooted in an original survey we fielded in the US and nine Western European countries. These unique surveys examine social policy preferences from a variety of perspectives, including as they relate to perceptions of fairness, policy trade-offs, inequality, and immigration.

### Welfare State Insiders and Outsiders

Who deserves our collective support? As a key issue in contemporary welfare states, answers to this question have differed dramatically across time, countries, and policy domains. On the one hand, while many welfare systems have been characterised by significant gaps in coverage, the extent to which governments have extended benefit access varies substantially. On the other, this process has been counterbalanced by efforts to restrict access in order to discourage dependency and limit expenditure. Such policy changes have important ramifications on poverty, inequality, and popular support for the welfare state.

My research exploring the divide between welfare state insiders and outsiders has appeared in the _[Journal of European Social Policy](https://anthonykevins.github.io/files/Political_Actors.pdf)_ and _[Socio-Economic Review](https://anthonykevins.github.io/files/Dualised_Trust.pdf)_. The project ultimately culminated in my recent (2017) monograph, _[Expanding Welfare in an Age of Austerity](http://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/distributed/E/bo26267228.html)_ (published by Amsterdam University Press and available through the University of Chicago Press in North America). The book concentrates on the dilemma leftist parties and unions face when confronted with coverage gaps under austerity, as they choose between maintaining the benefit levels of insiders and extending coverage to outsiders. It does so by starting from two sets of French-Italian comparisons (complemented by over half a year of field research) and building to both quantitative and qualitative tests of generalisability. I conclude that the role of certain key institutional features has been underemphasised in the literature. These (typically Southern European) factors shape party stances and policy outcomes both directly – through creating organisational incentives – and indirectly – through conditioning public opinion. Overall, the book pushes forward debates about the relationship between social policy preferences and benefit access, while at the same time offering real-world insights into social policy challenges under austerity.

My research investigates the interplay between public opinion and policy, with a special focus on marginalised groups and the welfare state. Some of the questions I've explored include: What factors shape the relationship between societal insiders and outsiders? How can we best understand social policy preferences? And what drives welfare state reform?

I am currently a Marie Curie Research Fellow at [Utrecht University's](https://www.uu.nl/en/) [School of Governance](https://www.uu.nl/en/organisation/utrecht-university-school-of-governance), where I work with [Barbara Vis](http://www.barbaravis.nl). My project (funded by an Individual Fellowship) examines preferences for differentiated representation, seeking to uncover when and why citizens believe that certain societal groups should have their voices amplified or ignored in the policy process.

Prior to taking up my current position, I held a 3-year Assistant Professorship in the [Department of Political Science](http://ps.au.dk/en/) at [Aarhus University](http://au.dk/en/), where I was affiliated with the UNIWEL (Universalism and the Welfare State) research project. My PhD (2014) is from [McGill University's](http://www.mcgill.ca/) [Department of Political Science](http://www.mcgill.ca/politicalscience/), where I was supervised by [Stuart Soroka](http://www.snsoroka.com).

My studies have been published in journals such as _Socio-Economic Review_, the _Journal of European Social Policy_, and _Political Studies_, and my work has been referenced in [The Globe and Mail](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/big-tent-politics-is-now-all-but-dead/article24944734/) and [Maclean's](https://www.macleans.ca/politics/this-is-whats-wrong-with-canadas-right/).

My research is focused on the interplay between public opinion and policy, with a special focus on marginalised groups and the welfare state. Some of the questions I've explored include: What factors shape the relationship between societal insiders and outsiders? How can we best understand social policy preferences? And what drives welfare state reform?

I am currently a Marie Curie Research Fellow at [Utrecht University's](https://www.uu.nl/en/) [School of Governance](https://www.uu.nl/en/organisation/utrecht-university-school-of-governance). My project (funded by an Individual Fellowship) examines preferences for unequal representation, seeking to uncover when and why citizens believe that certain societal groups should have their voices amplified or ignored in the policy process.

Prior to taking up my current position, I held a 3-year Assistant Professorship in the [Department of Political Science](http://ps.au.dk/en/) at [Aarhus University](http://au.dk/en/), where I was affiliated with the UNIWEL (Universalism and the Welfare State) research project. My research there concentrated on popular commitment to universalism and redistribution, culminating in a 10-country survey project on the topic.

My PhD is from [McGill University's](http://www.mcgill.ca/) [Department of Political Science](http://www.mcgill.ca/politicalscience/), where I worked with [Stuart Soroka](http://www.snsoroka.com). While at McGill, I explored the dilemma leftist parties and unions face when confronted with coverage gaps under austerity, as they choose between two problematic options: either extending coverage and retrenching the "good" benefits given to "insiders"; or maintaining the protection, coverage, and benefits of the relatively well-off at the expense of a growing class of excluded "outsiders".

My work has been published in journals such as the _Journal of European Social Policy_, _Socio-Economic Review_, and the _Canadian Journal of Political Science_. You can find more details about my ongoing and past research projects [here](http://anthonykevins.github.io/research.html) or via my [CV](http://anthonykevins.github.io/files/CV.pdf).
